1. Difference between hardened and non hardened keys:
Hardened keys are derived in a way that prevents anyone with access to a child private key
and the parent public key from being able to calculate the parent private key.
Non hardened keys, on the other hand, allow the parent public key and child private key to be used to compute the
parent private key, which can be a security risk if one of them is exposed.

2. Why wallet developers prefer deterministic wallets over non deterministic wallets:
Wallet developers prefer deterministic wallets because they can generate all keys
and addresses from a single seed phrase which makes backup, recovery, and management much simpler.
In non deterministic wallets, each key is generated randomly and stored individually,
which makes backups harder and recovery nearly impossible if keys are lost.
